# Regression with Neural Networks using TensorFlow

**Author:** Sharome Burton

**Aim:** Solve regression problems using TensorFlow.

Regression: estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome' or 'response' variable) and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', 'explanatory variables' or 'features'). The most common form of regression analysis is linear regression, in which one finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion.  

In simpler terms, predicting a numerical variable based on another combination of variables.
